# Overview

Have you ever tried to download a classic game like Tetris or Snake onto your phone or computer just for nostalgia's sake, but ad companies have just completely taken over the internet, so you can't play a game without hitting an ad every 30 seconds? Well look no further! What I've built is just regular tetris! You use the arrow keys to move falling blocks from the top of the screen and try to arrange them in a straight line. Once you do, that row disappears, and the stacked blocks go down. You earn 10 points for every block you place, and 40 points for every row you clear. Once the blocks stack to the top of the screen though, it's game over.

Left & Right arrow keys: Control the blocks from left to right
Space Bar: Rotate the blocks

# Development Environment

I used the Tkinter, Pygame, Random, and Time imports. 

I also used Python 3 to develop this game.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* There's a glitch that makes the blocks overlap, I need to fix that.
* I need to add sound effects.
* I need to change the blocks to alternating colors.
* The score doesn't add up with what I want the score to do.
